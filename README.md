## Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.

## Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number
Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

## Exercise 3: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.

For example, ```str = "pynative"``` so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.

## Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

For example:

* ```remove_chars("pynative", 4)``` so output must be ```tive```. Here, we need to remove the first four characters from a string.
* ```remove_chars("pynative", 2)``` so output must be ```native```. Here, we need to remove the first two characters from a string.

__Note:__ ```n``` must be less than the length of the string.

## Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same
Write a function to return ```True``` if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different then return ```False```.

## Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5 from a list
Iterate the given list of numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5
